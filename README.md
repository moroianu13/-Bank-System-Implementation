Bank System

Welcome to the Bank System repository! This project is a simple simulation of a banking system built in Python. It includes various classes to represent different components of a bank, such as bank accounts, customers, and transactions.


This bank system includes the following features:

Bank Account Management: Create and manage bank accounts with basic functionalities like depositing and withdrawing funds.

Interest Calculation: A specialized savings account class that calculates monthly interest.

Customer Management: Manage bank customers, allowing for the addition of new customers and the association of multiple accounts with each customer.

Transaction Logging: Every transaction (deposit and withdrawal) is logged with a timestamp for record-keeping.

Bank Management: A bank class that manages multiple customers and facilitates searching for customers by their IDs.
